# Example of Navigation. SwiftUI + Coordinator

> I want to find a good solution for navigation in SwiftUI 

### Requirements:
- I should be able to access the navigation from the ViewModel.
- Navigation should be easily extensible.
- Navigation may require additional parameters as arguments (id, objects, etc).
- ViewModel initialization should be handled by Coordinator.
